# Asynchronous Operations in TypeScript Using async/await
When building applications in TypeScript, handling asynchronous operations is crucial for creating responsive, performant code. While callbacks and Promises have traditionally been used for managing async tasks, the async and await syntax simplifies this approach, making asynchronous code cleaner and easier to work with.

This guide explains how to handle asynchronous operations with async/await in TypeScript, comparing it with traditional callbacks and Promises, and demonstrating practical examples.

Why Use async/await?
Using async/await over callbacks or Promises in TypeScript has several advantages:

Improved Readability: Code looks more like synchronous code, making it easier to read and understand.
Error Handling: You can handle errors with try/catch blocks, which is more intuitive than using .catch() with Promises.
Better Type Inference: TypeScript’s type system works smoothly with async/await, catching errors during compilation and reducing runtime issues.
How to Use async/await in TypeScript
Basic Example
Here’s a basic example of using async/await in TypeScript:

typescript
Copy code
async function fetchData(): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data fetched!");
    }, 1000);
  });
}

async function displayData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  }
}

displayData();
In this example:

The fetchData function returns a Promise that resolves after a timeout.
The displayData function is marked async so it can use await to pause until fetchData completes.
Errors are handled using a try/catch block, simplifying error management.
Chaining Asynchronous Operations
You can easily chain asynchronous operations using async/await, making the code more readable than with Promise chaining.

typescript
Copy code
async function fetchData(id: number): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(`Data for ID: ${id}`);
    }, 1000);
  });
}

async function getDataAndDisplay() {
  try {
    const data1 = await fetchData(1);
    const data2 = await fetchData(2);
    const data3 = await fetchData(3);
    console.log(data1, data2, data3);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  }
}

getDataAndDisplay();
In this example:

We sequentially fetch data for three different IDs and print each result.
If any fetch fails, the error is caught in a single catch block, providing centralized error handling.
Running Asynchronous Operations in Parallel
For operations that don’t depend on each other, you can use Promise.all with async/await to run them in parallel:

typescript
Copy code
async function fetchData(id: number): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(`Data for ID: ${id}`);
    }, 1000);
  });
}

async function getAllData() {
  try {
    const [data1, data2, data3] = await Promise.all([
      fetchData(1),
      fetchData(2),
      fetchData(3),
    ]);
    console.log(data1, data2, data3);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  }
}

getAllData();
Here:

All three fetchData calls are triggered simultaneously, reducing overall execution time.
Promise.all waits for all promises to resolve or rejects if any of them fails.
Summary
Using async/await in TypeScript improves readability, simplifies error handling, and allows for more maintainable asynchronous code. By moving from traditional callbacks and Promises to async/await, you can create cleaner, more concise TypeScript code that’s easier to debug and reason about.
